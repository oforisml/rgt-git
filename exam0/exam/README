Git-Docker Challenge
--------------------
Congrats for entering into the Git-Docker Challenge container.

* Note you will need to pass files to the host - Did you use a Volume?


Here is what you need to do:
(1) There is a git worktree in the ~/exam/task_01 folder:
        - rebase and merge all "feature/" branches into "master"
        - Make sure you merge correctly. It should be obvious how (git log --oneline --all --graph).


(2) after finishing task 1:
        a) Go into ~/exam/task_02 folder
        b) execute questions.sh, answer the questions. (the questions inside the ~/exam/task_02/questions.txt)
           - questions.sh will create file you need to submit in the /exam/submit folder
        c) execute prepare-answer.sh, passing in your name as a single parameter - e.g. "Paul Graham"
           - prepare-answer.sh will create the file you need to submit in the ~/exam/submit folder


(3) upload the files inside ~/exam/submit folder.
